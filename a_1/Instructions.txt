Try to use functions as much as possible in your code. Functions increase reusability and
the pass-by-value feature provides a significant help sometimes. Modularizing your code also
helps you to debug efficiently.

    • Use scanf to read characters/strings from STDIN. Avoid using getchar, getc or gets. Try
        to read up about character suppression in scanf as it will be very helpful in some of the
        problems.
    • Use printf instead of putc, putchar or puts to print character/string output on STDOUT.
    • Indent your code appropriately and use proper variable names. These increase readability
        and writability of the code. Also, use comments wherever necessary.
    • Use a proper IDEs like Sublime Text or VSCode as they help to run and test your code on
        multiple test-cases easily. You can install Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) or MinGW 7.3.0,
        if you are Windows user to compile and run your programs. Alternatively, you can run and
        test your codes on Online GDB. If you are using WSL or Linux to run your programs, make
        sure that the gcc version is gcc 5.4.1 c99.
